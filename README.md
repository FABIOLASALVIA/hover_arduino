Arduino Library for Hover (www.hoverlabs.co)

Hover is a development kit that lets you control your hardware projects in a whole new way.  
Wave goodbye to physical buttons. Hover detects hand movements in the air for touch-less interaction.  
It also features five touch-sensitive regions for even more options.
Hover uses I2C and 2 digital pins. It is compatible with Arduino, Raspberry Pi and more.
